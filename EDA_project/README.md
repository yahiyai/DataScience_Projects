The first figure shows the most 7 common mineral ores that found on earth. As see from this figure, 
Limestone ores have the most abundant on earth which nearly 28% compared to other mineral ores. 
Next, we have a bar plot of the count of three mineral ores includes (Limestone, Andesite, Diorite) 
that found on many countries like US, Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Argentina. It is clear that US has the 
largest amount of these mineral ores mainly due to its larger area. Argentina, on the other hand, has 
the lowest quantity of the three mineral ores especially Diorite rock.
